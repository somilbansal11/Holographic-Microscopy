# Holographic-Microscopy
A holographic microscope captures interference patterns, or holograms, that encode three-dimensional (3D) information about the object being viewed. Computation is essential to extracting that 3D information. By wrapping low-level scattering codes and taking advantage of Pythonâ€™s data analysis ecosystem, HoloPy makes it easy for experimentalists to use modern, sophisticated inference methods to analyze holograms. The project illustrates how computational tools can enable experimental methods and new experiments.
