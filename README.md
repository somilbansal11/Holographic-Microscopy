# Holographic-Microscopy
A holographic microscope captures interference patterns, or holograms, that encode three-dimensional (3D) information about the object being viewed. Computation is essential to extracting that 3D information. By wrapping low-level scattering codes and taking advantage of Pythonâ€™s data analysis ecosystem, HoloPy makes it easy for experimentalists to use modern, sophisticated inference methods to analyze holograms. The project illustrates how computational tools can enable experimental methods and new experiments.

HoloPy library calculates and gives the best fit model by comparing the experimemtal hologram and the scattering generated hologram via some initial guess.

Now we intend to use DeepLearning Models to find the best fit model and the positions of the particle.
OUR GOAL: is to compare the results we get after using DeepLearning and the results we got using the HoloPy library which follows the MCMC algorithm.
